    "- The `Account` class is an abstract base class for various types of accounts. It has an abstract method `account_type()`. The different types of accounts (`CurrentAccount`, `HomeLoanAccount`, etc.) are concrete classes that inherit from `Account` and implement the `account_type()` method.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Design Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encapsulation: \n",
    "The data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data are bundled together as a unit (class). This makes the code easier to understand and maintain, and protects the data from outside interference and misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance: \n",
    "This principle is used to define different types of accounts. A base class Account is defined and different types of accounts are derived from this base class, inheriting its properties and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polymorphism: \n",
    "This principle is used to allow different types of accounts to be created and handled using a unified interface. This makes the system flexible and easy to expand with new account types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The design also incorporates the following design patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategy Pattern: \n",
    "This pattern is used to define a family of interchangeable algorithms. In the context of the system, these algorithms are the different types of accounts. By encapsulating each as an object, we make them interchangeable within the context of the Account class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract Factory Pattern: \n",
    "This pattern is used to create objects of the Account class. A factory class AccountFactory is defined to provide an interface for creating objects of Account class, and different concrete factory classes are defined for creating different types of accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decorator Pattern: \n",
    "This pattern is used to add additional behaviors to an Account object dynamically. In the context of the system, this pattern is used to upgrade an account to a Bronze, Silver, or Gold account, adding additional features to the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Facade Pattern: \n",
    "This pattern is used to provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. In the context of the system, the BankingServices class provides a simplified interface for creating and upgrading accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of the Design Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flexibility: \n",
    "The use of the Strategy pattern allows the system to handle different types of accounts that have different behaviors. The system can easily be extended to handle new types of accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ease of expansion: \n",
    "The Abstract Factory pattern makes it easy to add new types of accounts. A new type of account can be added by defining a new concrete factory class without changing the existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamic behavior modification: \n",
    "The Decorator pattern allows behaviors of an account to be modified dynamically, providing flexibility in upgrading accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simplicity: \n",
    "The Facade pattern hides the complexities of the underlying system, providing a simple interface for creating and upgrading accounts. This makes the system easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future-proof: \n",
    "The design is robust against changes. New types of accounts can easily be added and existing accounts can easily be modified without changing the existing code. This makes the system more future-proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this design provides a robust, flexible, and extensible system for managing accounts in a banking system. The use of OOP principles and design patterns makes the system easy to understand, maintain, and expand, ensuring it is future-proof and adaptable to changing requirements."
